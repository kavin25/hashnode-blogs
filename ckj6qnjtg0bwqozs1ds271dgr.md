## How to make REST calls from inside VS Code?

In one of my previous blogs, I have talked about Postman and how useful it can be for both frontend and backend development. Click on the below link to check it out!

But, if you're like me, a person who likes to do major of his work in one software, then you'd also want to make REST calls inside of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my favourite editor, as of now).
So, a man, named Huachao Mao, made an extension called [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to overcome this problem, and believe me, it's been very useful for me, till now.

## Installing the extension
You can install the extension from inside VS Code by typing **Rest Client** inside the extensions search bar.

## Main Features

- Send GraphQL query and author GraphQL variables in editor
- Send cURL command in editor and copy HTTP request as cURL command
- Auto save and view/clear request history
- Organize MULTIPLE requests in the same file (separated by ### delimiter)
- View image response directly in pane
- Save raw response and response body only to local disk
- Fold and unfold response body
- Customize font(size/family/weight) in response preview
- Preview response with expected parts(headers only, body only, full response and both request and response)
- Authentication support for:
  - Basic Auth
  - Digest Auth
  - SSL Client Certificates
  - Azure Active Directory
  - Microsoft Identity Platform

    - {{$dotenv [%]variableName}}
    - {{$aadToken [new] [public|cn|de|us|ppe] [<domain|tenantId>] [aud:<domain|tenantId>]}}
  - Easily create/update/delete environments and environment variables in setting file
  - File variables can reference both custom and system variables
  - Support environment switch
  - Support shared environment to provide variables that available in all environments
- Generate code snippets for HTTP request in languages like Python, JavaScript and more!

## Making a GET Request
Let's start by making a GET Request.
- In VS Code, open a new file, and name it with the extension **.rest** or **.http**

- Add a url prefixing it with **GET ** like so 
```
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

> I have used the JSONPlaceholder.typicode.com fake rest api for demonstration purposes. You can use any url which supports get.

- Now click on the **Send Request** button which has showed up above the url and you should get the response in a split window like so

Pretty easy, right? üëç

## Making a POST request
- To separate two requests in a rest file, use the below
```
###
```

- Now, for a POST request, start like before and add the below line
  ```
  POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
  ```
  - In a **POST** request, we usually send a **request body** and if you've used fetch 
api or some other way of fetching a post request, you would know,  that we need to set the `content` to `application/json` to send a request body as json. 

    To do that we add the line given below just below the request URL.
    ```
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```
  - Adding a **request body**
    Leave a line after the **Content-Type** line and add the request body like so

   ```json
   {
    "userId" : 1,
    "title": "Hello World from REST Client VSCode",
    "body": "This is how to make a REST Call from inside VSCode"
  }
  ```
  - Now click on the **Send Request** button

And that's it... We've come to an end to the basics of the **REST Client** extension inside VSCode. As time goes on, you can read the documentation for your use case like adding authentication tokens, adding headers, etc.

That's it for today, and I hope you found something useful from this. You can find the code used above in the following gist

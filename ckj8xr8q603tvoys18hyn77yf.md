This article is part of a series regarding **Complete Beginners Guide to Django**. So, if you haven't seen the first part of this series, check it out at

So, after following the instructions in the first part, your file structure should like this

```
.
├── db.sqlite3
├── livecode247
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __pycache__
│   │   ├── __init__.cpython-38.pyc
│   │   ├── settings.cpython-38.pyc
│   │   ├── urls.cpython-38.pyc
│   │   └── wsgi.cpython-38.pyc
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py
└── myenv
    └── *

```
## manage.py

`manage.py` is basically the main file of our whole project which runs our application. This file is rarely edited manually if not never. I have never had to edit it for anything

## db.sqlite3

`db.sqlite3` is the default `sqlite` database created by Django for our use. We will be using this database to store data regarding our application like blogs, the content inside them, etc.

## livecode247 directory
### __init__.py
An empty file file that tells Python that this directory should be a Python package

### __pycache__
This directory is just some stuff which is generated by Django for caching stuff. It's not of much use to us

### asgi.py
A file which helps us to deploy our app with ASGI-compatible web servers.

### wsgi.py
A file which helps us to deploy our app with WSGI-compatible web servers.

### settings.py
Stores all the settings and configurations for our projects. We will be updating this quite frequently

### urls.py
Stores all the urls of the site and what view they point to.

In the next part of this series, we will be talking about how to create an **app** in our project and add a basic **hello world** page.

- Now select the frame like done in [Step 1](#step1) and make a group of the frame by doing `Command G` on MacOS or `Control G` on other OS's.

- Now, you would notice that the texts are not as well sized as they should have been. So we will have to tweak the font sizes a little bit.
> Note: The images, shapes and svgs, etc. would be well sized because of [Step 3](#step3)

At the end after tweaking your font sizes, you should get something like this
